# StudyAppHackathon
## An Android application called SafeStudy, created for the 2021/09 Napier Hackathon event
We wanted to create an app that would allow  students to safely create and join study groups for different modules. 4.	This app allows them to alert their study buddies of potential threat of infection and to be alerted as well.
